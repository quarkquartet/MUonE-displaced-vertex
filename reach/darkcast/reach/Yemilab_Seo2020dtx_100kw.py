This limit is a projection for the proposed Yemilab search of
Seo:2020dtx using a di-electron final state and a 100 kW beam. Note,
other limits, including three photon and absorption are also
projected, but not available in Darkcast. These limits were provided

This is a displaced search where the decay volume length over the
shield length is 20/0.5.
